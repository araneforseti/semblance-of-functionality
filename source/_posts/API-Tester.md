[API Tester](https://github.com/araneforseti/api-tester) is my attempt to automate myself out of ever doing boilerplate API testing ever again.

It checks many common issues with APIs such as consistent error messaging via doing a variety of calls based on how you tell it the API works (ideally based on the API's documentation)

While as of writing this API Tester's DSL is rough to use, the concepts it represents are valuable ones any API Team should consider.
