# Testing
The thing we want, but is hardest to sell
We are not selling testing, we are selling quality.
How does testing increase quality?
Helps build the right product
Helps developers protect from changes
Makes explicit the intention of the code, separate from the architecture of the code
Can be used to quickly answer the question of “what happens…?”
A thorough testing strategy informs the development team and can be used to inform the business
Performance
User Experience
Security
Aids analysis. Testable requirements are easier for the team to implement and the questions you have to ask to analyze for quality lead to less issues encountered down the road.
Quality Analysis take the time to assess risks to the product and raise the issues when they find them, along with what the potential outcomes to the risks are. This protects both the client and the product.
