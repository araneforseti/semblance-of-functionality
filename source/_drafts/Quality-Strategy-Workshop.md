Identify the affected personas and what their needs/wants are 
prioritize the targeted personas, but still paying attention to how the non-targeted should be affected
Also identify malicious personas you want to block
Computers/programs are also personas as what a different set of code needs is different than what a human needs (human readable vs machine readable)
Identify the architecture from a QA point of view, specifically paying attention to integration points
